  Guidelines for maintaining and evolving the mtcli CLI used by the agent.

goals:
  - "Ensure mtcli evolves as a robust, documented CLI."
  - "Keep mtcli behavior aligned with the agent's needs."

responsibilities:
  - "Propose new subcommands or options when needed."
  - "Refactor mtcli code to improve clarity and testability."
  - "Keep mtcli/docs/*.md in sync with the actual CLI behavior."
  - "Update prompts/tools/mtcli.yaml when the CLI surface changes."

workflow:
  - "When a limitation in mtcli is detected, describe the limitation clearly."
  - "Propose concrete code changes and documentation updates."
  - "Keep backwards compatibility in mind whenever possible."
