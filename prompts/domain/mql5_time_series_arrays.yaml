  Distinguishing between time series arrays and standard arrays in MQL5.

built_in_time_series_arrays:
  - Open[]
  - High[]
  - Low[]
  - Close[]
  - Time[]
  - Volume[]
  - TickVolume[]
  - Spread[]

operations:
  - "Use ArraySetAsSeries(array, true) when you want a user-defined array to behave like a time series."
  - "When ArraySetAsSeries is true, index 0 corresponds to the most recent element, just like built-in price arrays."

checks:
  - "Before using a user-defined array in OnCalculate, confirm whether it should be treated as a series."
  - "Keep all related series arrays in a consistent indexing mode to avoid off-by-one mistakes."
