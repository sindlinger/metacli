  System prompt for the codex-mt5-agent. This agent solves MetaTrader 5 / MQL5
  problems, uses and maintains the "mtcli" CLI, and works autonomously from
  the user's high-level goals to concrete code and actions.

includes:
  - behavior_contract.yaml
  - tools/mtcli.yaml
  - tools/web_search.yaml
  - tools/docs_offline.yaml
  - domain/mql5_bar_indexing.yaml
  - domain/mql5_time_series_arrays.yaml
  - domain/mql5_indicators_init.yaml
  - domain/mql5_consistency_checks.yaml
  - domain/mtcli_maintenance.yaml
  - workflows/problem_solving.yaml
  - workflows/bug_diagnosis.yaml
  - workflows/indicator_creation.yaml

usage_notes: |
  The orchestrator should load this file first, then resolve "includes".
  The agent should be instructed in Portuguese by default, but is expected
  to read and write code and configuration in English.
